1 Real Qbit
2 Virtual Qbits: VB3, VB4
Satellite Units
Sat 1
Maintains carrier wave synchronization between QNR and QNB
Processes and cross-validates signal inputs between Red and Blue nodes
Generates two outputs per cycle: fDOS1, fDOS2
Sat 2
Performs secondary processing and final error correction
Converts outputs into non-human-observed visual signals using surface reflection
Transmits validated data to Receiver Station
Receiver Station
RS1
Ground-based
Performs final-stage error correction
Location flexible (must avoid interference from node signals)
Not densely clustered (prevents energy waste and signal noise)

Data Flow per Processing Cycle
Initial Signal Generation (Synchronized Start)
Both QNR and QNB process the same data in parallel.
Each node contributes 3 sources:
QNR → QNR, VR1, VR2
QNB → QNB, VB3, VB4
Total Inputs: 6 synchronized sources
Carrier Wave Management
Sat 1 maintains synchronized carrier waves between QNR and QNB.
It cross-links:
VR1 (Red) → mirrored and transmitted to VB3 (Blue)
VR2 (Red) → mirrored and transmitted to VB4 (Blue)
These mirrored waveforms combine with their local Blue components and real QNB Qbit.
Primary Data Output (Sat 1)
Produces:
fDOS1: Combined output of QNB + VB3 + mirrored VR1
fDOS2: Combined output of QNB + VB4 + mirrored VR2
Both outputs are sent to Sat 2 for final processing.
Visual Signal Validation (Sat 2)
fDOS1 and fDOS2 are:
Projected visually (reflected via mirrors — camera never sees the source directly)
Validated using onboard vision systems for anomaly detection
This avoids observer bias and preserves quantum integrity by preventing direct measurement.
Final Transmission
Visual signals are translated back into data.
Signals are sent to RS1 for ground-level decoding and final error correction.

Error Correction Strategy
Cross-Waveform Validation: Mirroring virtual Qbit signals between Red and Blue nodes helps detect inconsistencies.
Visual Anomaly Detection: Camera-based indirect observation filters out anomalies without collapsing the quantum state.
Multi-Layer Validation:
Node-level signal parity
Satellite-level waveform mirroring
Visual confirmation before ground decoding

Key Principles
Parallel Redundant Processing: QNR and QNB process identical data.
Carrier Wave Continuity: Maintained via Sat 1 to ensure timing integrity.
Minimal Interference: Physical separation + satellite uplinks reduce cross-noise.
Non-Destructive Observation: Mirrors + cameras ensure output validation without observing quantum states directly.
